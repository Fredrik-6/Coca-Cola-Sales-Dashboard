Coca-Cola Sales Dashboard Project

This project involved creating an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze Coca-Cola sales data. The goal was to provide insights into sales performance across different regions and channels, helping identify key trends and growth opportunities.

Project Overview

The dashboard was designed to offer a comprehensive view of Coca-Cola's sales metrics, including revenue, sales volume, and market share. It provided an easy-to-understand interface for stakeholders to explore the data and make data-driven decisions.

Key Features

Regional Breakdown: Analyzed sales performance across different regions, enabling comparisons between geographic areas and identifying regional leaders.
Channel Analysis: Evaluated sales across different sales channels (e.g., retail, wholesale), providing insights into which channels contributed the most to overall sales.
KPIs and Metrics: The dashboard displayed key performance indicators such as total revenue, percentage growth, and market share to give a quick overview of business health.
Data Filters: Included interactive filters to allow users to explore the data in detail, such as filtering by specific regions, time periods, or sales channels.

Data Source and Preparation:
The data was sourced from Kaggle, and significant cleaning and preparation were done to ensure high data quality. Data transformation techniques were applied to handle missing values, format the data consistently, and prepare it for analysis.

Tools and Technologies:
Power BI: Used for creating visualizations and building the dashboard.
Excel: Assisted in the initial data cleaning and organization.
